# Understanding Prompts: The Key to GenAI (20 Minutes)

## ✨ Mini-Lecture: What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective instructions (called "prompts") to get the most useful, accurate, or creative output from a Generative AI (GenAI) model like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

Think of a prompt as the *question* or *instruction* you give the model. Like talking to a human assistant, the quality of the answer depends heavily on *how* you ask.

Prompt engineering is a skill that includes:

- Understanding how the model interprets instructions.
- Providing clear, contextual, and goal-aligned queries.
- Refining your prompts based on trial and error.

## 🔍 Clarity: Be Specific About the Output You Want

**Bad Prompt:**

> Tell me about dogs.

**Improved Prompt:**

> Give me a 3-paragraph overview of Golden Retrievers, including their temperament, common health issues, and suitability as family pets.

### Why It Works:

- Specific dog breed
- Output format: 3 paragraphs
- Clear areas to cover

---

## 📄 Context: Provide Relevant Background Information

**Without Context:**

> Suggest improvements for this resume.

**With Context:**

> I'm applying for a mid-level data analyst role at a fintech startup. Here's my resume. Please suggest improvements that highlight relevant experience in SQL, dashboarding tools, and financial data analysis.

### Why It Works:

- Provides the job context
- Clarifies which skills to emphasize

---

## ✅ Constraints: Define Output Format, Tone, Length, Key Details

**Prompt with Constraints:**

> Write a professional LinkedIn post (max 100 words) in an enthusiastic but respectful tone, announcing that I’ve joined Microsoft as a Product Manager. Mention my prior role at Adobe but don’t list any job duties.

### Why It Works:

- Clear format: LinkedIn post
- Tone: enthusiastic + respectful
- Length: max 100 words
- Inclusion/exclusion rules

## ♻️ Iteration: Refining Prompts to Improve Output

Sometimes, the first output won't be perfect. Use follow-up prompts or adjust your original prompt.

**Example:**

> First Prompt: Summarize this research paper.

*Model's Output:* Overly technical and too long.

> Follow-up Prompt: Simplify that summary for a non-technical audience in 3 short paragraphs.

*Model's Output:* More accessible and concise.

### Why Iteration Matters:

- Allows fine-tuning tone, structure, clarity, and length
- Mimics how humans revise and improve over time

## ✨ Bonus Tips for Learners:

- Use bullet points, tables, or examples if needed
- Ask for multiple variations: "Give me 3 options"
- Combine tasks: "Summarize and suggest 3 headlines"

---

By mastering prompt engineering, learners can unlock more effective and reliable responses from GenAI models, whether for coding help, writing tasks, research, or creative work.
