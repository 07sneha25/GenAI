# Hands-on: Circular Creation 
#  Scenario: The Pollution Control Board is issuing a circular to all registered industries outlining new guidelines for effluent treatment and discharge, including a revised reporting format.
* Instructions:
* Groups remain the same.
* Task: Draft a circular using a GenAI tool.
* Prompting Guidance (provide key details):
* "Draft a circular from the [Your State/City] Pollution Control Board to all registered industrial units."
* "Subject: Revised Guidelines for Effluent Treatment and Discharge and Updated Reporting Format."
* "Reference: Previous Circular No. [Provide a dummy number] dated [Provide a dummy date]."
* "Key points to include:"
* "Mandatory upgrade of Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) by [Date]."
* "New permissible limits for [mention 2-3 pollutants, e.g., BOD, COD, TSS] as per [mention a dummy regulation name/standard]."
* "Requirement to submit monthly compliance reports in the new prescribed format (refer to Annexure A, even if it's not actually provided, for prompting purposes)."
* "Details on inspections and potential legal action for non-compliance."
* "Contact person/department for clarifications."
* "Tone: Official, clear, and directive."
* "Structure: Use numbered points or sections for clarity."
* Emphasis on Iteration: Encourage groups to refine their prompts multiple times based on the initial output. Did the AI include all the specific points? Is the tone correct? Is it well-structured?
* Sharing & Discussion: Have a few groups share their circulars and discuss the challenges faced in prompting for complex information and how they overcame them. Highlight how GenAI can handle detailed instructions.

## Solution:--
Act as a senior officer from the [Your State/City Name] Pollution Control Board, drafting an official circular.

Subject: Implementation of Revised Guidelines for Effluent Treatment and Discharge and Updated Reporting Format

This circular is addressed to all registered industrial units operating within [Your State/City Name].

Reference: Previous Circular No. PCB/[Year]/[Dummy Number] dated [Dummy Date, e.g., January 15, 2024], which this circular supersedes in relevant sections.

Detail the following mandatory guidelines and requirements:
1.  **Mandatory Upgrade of Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs):** All industrial units must upgrade their ETPs to meet the new standards by **[Specific Date, e.g., December 31, 2025]**.
2.  **New Permissible Discharge Limits:** Specify the revised limits for the following pollutants:
    * Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD): Max [Specify Value] mg/L
    * Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): Max [Specify Value] mg/L
    * Total Suspended Solids (TSS): Max [Specify Value] mg/L
    * These limits are in accordance with the **[Name of Dummy Regulation/Standard, e.g., Environmental (Protection) (Amendment) Rules, 2025]**.
3.  **Revised Monthly Compliance Reporting:**
    * Units are now required to submit monthly effluent quality monitoring reports.
    * **The reporting format has been updated.** Refer to the **"New Effluent Discharge Report Format - Annexure A"** (which will be provided separately) for detailed instructions and data fields.
    * Reports must be submitted digitally via the PCB's online portal by the **5th of every succeeding month**.
4.  **Inspections and Enforcement:**
    * The Board will conduct unannounced inspections to verify compliance with these new guidelines.
    * Strict legal action, including penalties, plant closure, and prosecution under relevant environmental laws ([Refer to a dummy act, e.g., The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974]), will be initiated against non-compliant units.

Ensure a clear, directive, and official tone. Structure the content using numbered points for readability and ease of understanding for industrial units.
