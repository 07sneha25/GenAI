## Hands-on: Circular Creation 
#  Scenario: The Pollution Control Board is issuing a circular to all registered industries outlining new guidelines for effluent treatment and discharge, including a revised reporting format.
* Instructions:
* Groups remain the same.
* Task: Draft a circular using a GenAI tool.
* Prompting Guidance (provide key details):
* "Draft a circular from the [Your State/City] Pollution Control Board to all registered industrial units."
* "Subject: Revised Guidelines for Effluent Treatment and Discharge and Updated Reporting Format."
* "Reference: Previous Circular No. [Provide a dummy number] dated [Provide a dummy date]."
* "Key points to include:"
* "Mandatory upgrade of Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) by [Date]."
* "New permissible limits for [mention 2-3 pollutants, e.g., BOD, COD, TSS] as per [mention a dummy regulation name/standard]."
* "Requirement to submit monthly compliance reports in the new prescribed format (refer to Annexure A, even if it's not actually provided, for prompting purposes)."
* "Details on inspections and potential legal action for non-compliance."
* "Contact person/department for clarifications."
* "Tone: Official, clear, and directive."
* "Structure: Use numbered points or sections for clarity."
* Emphasis on Iteration: Encourage groups to refine their prompts multiple times based on the initial output. Did the AI include all the specific points? Is the tone correct? Is it well-structured?
* Sharing & Discussion: Have a few groups share their circulars and discuss the challenges faced in prompting for complex information and how they overcame them. Highlight how GenAI can handle detailed instructions.
